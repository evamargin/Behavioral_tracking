# Here I m collecting nice coding tips cz i dont want to figure out same shit over and over again

## Path handling

**1/ Best**
```
from pathlib import Path
filename = Path(pp_path) / f"smooth_pitch_dict_{date}.pkl"
```
- Clean, chainable: Path("a") / "b" / "c.txt"

**2/ 2nd chunky winner**
```
import os
filename = os.path.join(pp_path, f"smooth_pitch_dict_{date}.pkl")
```
- Automatically handles slashes (/ on Linux/macOS, \\ on Windows)
- robust
- useful if jumping from Windows to Linux 

**3/ retarded (and most used by me in the past)**
```
filename = res_path + "/ttl_from_mdat.npy"
filename = f"{pp_path}/smooth_pitch_dict_{date}.pkl"
```
- if you forget a /, or if res_path ends with / --> u re fuked
